# Algorithmic Thinking
... and __Problem Solving__

- Programming problems can be complex
- Break it down into smaller steps

## MSI-Process
1. __Manually__ solve the problem,  
   ex. solve it in your head or on paper
2. __Split__ your solution into smaller steps,  
   ex. write each step as a __comment__ into your code
3. __Implement__ each step:
    1. __Code__ the step.  
       Do we know how? Do we need to research?
    3. __Print__ the result of the step.  
       Did we solve this step?
    4. __Understand__ the result.  
       Unexpected result? Error messages? Fix and repeat until working!
